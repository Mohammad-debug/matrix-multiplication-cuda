# CUDA Matrix Multiplication Project

## Overview

This CUDA project demonstrates matrix multiplication using both the GPU (via CUDA) and CPU to compare performance. Matrix multiplication is a computationally intensive task, and leveraging the parallel processing power of a GPU can lead to significant speedup.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support.
- CUDA Toolkit installed ([Download CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)).
- C/C++ Compiler:`nvcc`.
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).
